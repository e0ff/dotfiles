# dotfiles
My dotfiles

## What I use
 1. doom emacs
 2. zsh
 3. tmux
 4. neovim
 5. alacritty

My emacs and neovim configs are in separate repos.

## Install
 1. Clone this repository.
 2. Run the install.sh script, it will backup your current dotfiles to a folder named old_dotfiles.
 3. If you want my home directory structure then run setup-dirs.sh

## Uninstall
 1. Change your shell back to bash if you are going to remove zsh.
 2. Run the uninstall.sh script and move your old dotfiles back.
